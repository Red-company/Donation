## Our status:

Now, we're just creating projects that will help us in the implementation of our _BIG PLAN_.<br/><br/>
Now, we're just making the _name_. Our _purpose_ is to _provide safety_ for people and organizations that will be _public_, <br/><br/>

-_**EASY (.سهل)**_- to understand,<br/>
-_**OPEN (.افتح)**_- for developers and<br/>
-_**SECURE (.يؤمن)**_- for everyone.<br/><br/>

Now, we're just starting working on our plan and _creating standards_ that will _help people_ being sure in their _data's safety_.<br/><br/>
Now, if you're reading this, be sure, we will be _#1 provider of security_ in the future.<br/><br/>
The most of our work is doing _offline_ and now we're having a lack of work power, but we're aimed at our goals and we are moving towards them _step by step_, commit by commit. And sooner or later, _we will reach our goals_.<br/><br/>
